    "One of the most common language models is the unigram model, a statistical language model commonly known as bag-of-words. As its name suggests, bag-of-words does not have much order to its chaos! What it does have is a tally count of each instance for each word.\n",

    "\n",
    "We’ve touched on the idea of finding topics within a body of language. But what if the text is long and the topics aren’t obvious?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is an area of NLP dedicated to uncovering latent, or hidden, topics within a body of language. For example, one Codecademy curriculum developer used topic modeling to discover patterns within Taylor Swift songs related to love and heartbreak over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common technique is to deprioritize the most common words and prioritize less frequently used terms as topics in a process known as term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). Say what?! This may sound counter-intuitive at first. Why would you want to give more priority to less-used words? Well, when you’re working with a lot of text, it makes a bit of sense if you don’t want your topics filled with words like “the” and “is.” The Python libraries gensim and sklearn have modules to handle tf-idf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you use your plain bag of words (which will give you term frequency) or run it through tf-idf, the next step in your topic modeling journey is often latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA is a statistical model that takes your documents and determines which words keep popping up together in the same contexts (i.e., documents). We’ll use sklearn to tackle this for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any interest in visualizing your newly minted topics, word2vec is a great technique to have up your sleeve. word2vec can map out your topic model results spatially as vectors so that similarly used words are closer together. In the case of a language sample consisting of “The squids jumped out of the suitcases. The squids were furious. Why are your suitcases full of jumping squids?”, we might see that “suitcase”, “jump”, and “squid” were words used within similar contexts. This word-to-vector mapping is known as a word embedding."

    "\n",
    "Most of us have a good autocorrect story. Our phone’s messenger quietly swaps one letter for another as we type and suddenly the meaning of our message has changed (to our horror or pleasure). However, addressing text similarity — including spelling correction — is a major challenge within natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing word similarity and misspelling for spellcheck or autocorrect often involves considering the Levenshtein distance or minimal edit distance between two words. The distance is calculated through the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions that would need to occur for one word to become another. For example, turning “bees” into “beans” would require one substitution (“a” for “e”) and one insertion (“n”), so the Levenshtein distance would be two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phonetic similarity is also a major challenge within speech recognition. English-speaking humans can easily tell from context whether someone said “euthanasia” or “youth in Asia,” but it’s a far more challenging task for a machine! More advanced autocorrect and spelling correction technology additionally considers key distance on a keyboard and phonetic similarity (how much two words or phrases sound the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also helpful to find out if texts are the same to guard against plagiarism, which we can identify through lexical similarity (the degree to which texts use the same vocabulary and phrases). Meanwhile, semantic similarity (the degree to which documents contain similar meaning or topics) is useful when you want to find (or recommend) an article or book similar to one you recently finished."

    "\n",
    "How does your favorite search engine complete your search queries? How does your phone’s keyboard know what you want to type next? Language prediction is an application of NLP concerned with predicting text given preceding text. Autosuggest, autocomplete, and suggested replies are common forms of language prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step to language prediction is picking a language model. Bag of words alone is generally not a great model for language prediction; no matter what the preceding word was, you will just get one of the most commonly used words from your training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go the n-gram route, you will most likely rely on Markov chains to predict the statistical likelihood of each following word (or character) based on the training corpus. Markov chains are memory-less and make statistical predictions based entirely on the current n-gram on hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s take a sentence beginning, “I ate so many grilled cheese”. Using a trigram model (where n is 3), a Markov chain would predict the following word as “sandwiches” based on the number of times the sequence “grilled cheese sandwiches” has appeared in the training data out of all the times “grilled cheese” has appeared in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more advanced approach, using a neural language model, is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM uses deep learning with a network of artificial “cells” that manage memory, making them better suited for text prediction than traditional neural networks."

    "### 8 - Advanced NLP Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a slew of advanced topics and applications of NLP, many of which rely on deep learning and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are supervised machine learning algorithms that leverage a probabilistic theorem to make predictions and classifications. They are widely used for sentiment analysis (determining whether a given block of language expresses negative or positive feelings) and spam filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve made enormous gains in machine translation, but even the most advanced translation software using neural networks and LSTM still has far to go in accurately translating between languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most life-altering applications of NLP are focused on improving language accessibility for people with disabilities. Text-to-speech functionality and speech recognition have improved rapidly thanks to neural language models, making digital spaces far more accessible places.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP can also be used to detect bias in writing and speech. Feel like a political candidate, book, or news source is biased but can’t put your finger on exactly how? Natural language processing can help you identify the language at issue."

    "As you’ve seen, there are a vast array of applications for NLP. However, as they say, “with great language processing comes great responsibility” (or something along those lines). When working with NLP, we have several important considerations to take into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "Different NLP tasks may be more or less difficult in different languages. Because so many NLP tools are built by and for English speakers, these tools may lag behind in processing other languages. The tools may also be programmed with cultural and linguistic biases specific to English speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your Amazon Alexa could only understand wealthy men from coastal areas of the United States? English itself is not a homogeneous body. English varies by person, by dialect, and by many sociolinguistic factors. When we build and train NLP tools, are we only building them for one type of English speaker?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have the best intentions and still inadvertently program a bigoted tool. While NLP can limit bias, it can also propagate bias. As an NLP developer, it’s important to consider biases, both within your code and within the training corpus. A machine will learn the same biases you teach it, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you become someone who builds tools with natural language processing, it’s vital to take into account your users’ privacy. There are many powerful NLP tools that come head-to-head with privacy concerns. Who is collecting your data? How much data is being collected and what do those companies plan to do with your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural language processing combines computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence to enable computers to process human languages.\n",
    "- NLTK is a Python library used for NLP.\n",
    "- Text preprocessing is a stage of NLP focused on cleaning and preparing text for other NLP tasks.\n",
    "- Parsing is a stage of NLP concerned with breaking up text based on syntax.\n",
    "- Language models are probabilistic machine models of language use for NLP comprehension tasks. Common models include bag-of-words, n-gram models, and neural language modeling.\n",
    "- Topic modeling is the NLP process by which hidden topics are identified given a body of text.\n",
    "- Text similarity is a facet of NLP concerned with semblance between instances of language.\n",
    "- Language prediction is an application of NLP concerned with predicting language given preceding language.\n",
    "- There are many social and ethical considerations to take into account when designing NLP tools."
