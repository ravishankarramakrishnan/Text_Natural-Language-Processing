    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing is an approach for cleaning and preparing text data for use in a specific context. Developers use it in almost all natural language processing (NLP) pipelines, including voice recognition software, search engine lookup, and machine learning model training. It is an essential step because text data can vary. From its format (website, text message, voice recognition) to the people who create the text (language, dialect), there are plenty of things that can introduce noise into your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of cleaning and preparing text data is to reduce the text to only the words that you need for your NLP goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn strategies for preparing text data. While this list is not exhaustive, we will cover a few common approaches for cleaning and processing text data. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Regex & NLTK libraries\n",
    "- Removing unnecessary characters and formatting\n",
    "- Tokenization – break multi-word strings into smaller components\n",
    "- Normalization – a catch-all term for processing data; this includes stemming and lemmatization\n"

    "### 1 - Noise Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cleaning is a technique that developers use in a variety of domains. Depending on the goal of your project and where you get your data from, you may want to remove unwanted information, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- punctuation and accents\n",
    "- special characters\n",
    "- numeric digits\n",
    "- leading, ending, and vertical whitespace\n",
    "- HTML formatting\n",
    "- The type of noise that you need to remove from text usually depends on its source. For example, you could access data via the - Twitter API, scraping a webpage, or voice recognition software. Fortunately, you can use the .sub() method in Python’s regular expression (re) library for most of your noise removal needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .sub() method has three required arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pattern – a regular expression that is searched for in the input string. There must be an r preceding the string to indicate it is a raw string, which treats backslashes as literal characters.\n",
    "- replacement_text – text that replaces all matches in the input string\n",
    "- input – the input string that will be edited by the .sub() method\n",
    "\n",
    "The method returns a string with all instances of the pattern replaced by the replacement_text. Let’s see a few examples of using this method to remove and replace text from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "First, let’s consider how to remove HTML <p> tags from a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "import re <br>\n",
    "text = \"\\p>This is a paragraph\\/p>\" <br>\n",
    "result = re.sub(r'<.?p>', '', text)<br>\n",
    "print(result) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, we replace the tags with an empty string ''. This is a common approach for removing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s remove the whitespace from the beginning of the text. The whitespace consists of four spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "import re \n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"    This is a paragraph\" \n",
    "\n",
    "result = re.sub(r'\\s{4}', '', text)\n",

    "\n",
    "For many natural language processing tasks, we need access to each word in a string. To access each word, we first have to break the text into smaller components. The method for breaking text into smaller components is called tokenization and the individual components are called tokens.\n",
